# Embed Widget

A widget for embedding scripts and embed codes, with additional checking and balancing to help with debugging, a former CFTP creation. The code provides:

 - An intro section for plain text that sits above the embed code
 - An embed code box
 - Checks to catch PHP tags and flag them
 - Tag balancing
 - HTML validation
 
Should bad code be entered, it will flag it with a list of errors found during validation after saving
